## Core Infrastructure

### Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
- **Purpose**: Container orchestration platform hosting all application microservices
- **Configuration**: Managed through OpenTofu/Terraform
- **Notes**: Provides scalability and reliability for the application workloads

### Azure Container Registry (ACR)
- **Purpose**: Private Docker registry for storing and managing container images
- **Integration**: Used in CI/CD pipelines for image storage and deployment to AKS

### Azure Storage Account
- **Purpose**: Multi-purpose storage solution
- **Current Usage**: 
  - OpenTofu state storage (configured in backend.tf)
  - General blob storage for application data

### Azure Virtual Network
- **Purpose**: Network isolation and security boundary
- **Configuration**: Segmented with subnets for different application tiers
- **Notes**: Implements network security groups and access controls

## Database & Data Services

### Azure Cosmos DB / Azure SQL Database
- **Purpose**: Primary application database
- **Usage**: Stores user data, scenario templates, session information, and interaction records

### Azure Cache for Redis
- **Purpose**: In-memory data structure store for caching and session management
- **Usage**: Improves application performance and supports real-time features

### Azure Blob Storage
- **Purpose**: Object storage for VR assets, media files, and user-generated content
- **Notes**: Configured with CDN for faster content delivery

## Identity & Security

### Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)
- **Purpose**: Identity provider for user authentication and authorization
- **Integration**: Provides SSO capabilities and role-based access control

### Azure Key Vault
- **Purpose**: Secure storage for application secrets and certificates
- **Usage**: Stores database connection strings, API keys, and other sensitive information

### Azure DDoS Protection
- **Purpose**: Protection against distributed denial-of-service attacks
- **Integration**: Applied at the network level

## DevOps & Monitoring

### Azure Monitor
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive monitoring solution for application health and performance
- **Usage**: Collects and analyzes telemetry data from all application components

### Azure Log Analytics
- **Purpose**: Centralized logging solution
- **Usage**: Aggregates logs from multiple sources for analysis and troubleshooting

### Azure Application Insights
- **Purpose**: Application Performance Monitoring (APM) service
- **Usage**: Tracks application performance, user behavior, and exceptions

## Additional Services

### Azure API Management
- **Purpose**: API gateway for managing and securing APIs
- **Potential Use**: If exposing APIs to external consumers or partners

### Azure CDN
- **Purpose**: Global content delivery network
- **Usage**: Accelerates delivery of static assets for the frontend application

### Azure SignalR Service
- **Purpose**: Adds real-time web functionality
- **Potential Use**: For implementing chat, notifications, or other real-time features

### Azure Cognitive Services
- **Purpose**: AI and machine learning capabilities
- **Potential Use**: For implementing intelligent features or analytics

### Azure Functions
- **Purpose**: Serverless compute service
- **Potential Use**: For background processing, scheduled tasks, or event-driven architecture
```

## Deployment and Configuration

Deployment of these resources is managed through OpenTofu/Terraform infrastructure-as-code patterns. Configuration files can be found in the infrastructure directory of the project.

## Monitoring and Maintenance

Regular monitoring of these services should be conducted through Azure Monitor and the Azure Portal. Cost optimization reviews are recommended on a quarterly basis.
